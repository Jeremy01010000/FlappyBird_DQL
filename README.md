# About this Project
When Flappy Bird was released, my friends and I would play it often. Therefore I programmed my own version of Flappy Bird using pygame. For this project, I've formated the code to be played by an AI which makes the use of **Deep Q Learning** to help the AI have a more stable learning process.
